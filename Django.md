## Django - Cheat Sheet

Set up a new virtual environment named env.
```shell
python3 -m venv env
```

Activate the virtual environment.
```shell
source env/bin/activate
```

Install Django into the dedicated dev workspace. (This command it's used to install packages in the dev environment).
```shell
python3 -m pip install django
```

Pin the dependencies to make sure that we are keeping track of which Django version we have installed.
```shell
python3 -m pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

You should always include a record of the versions of all packages you used in your project code, such as in a requirements.txt file. The requirements.txt file allows you and other programmers to reproduce the exact conditions of your project build.

Suppose youâ€™re working on an existing project with its dependencies already pinned in a requirements.txt file.
In that case, you can install the right Django version as well as all the other necessary packages in a single command.
```shell
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a Django project.
```shell
django-admin startproject <name-of-project>
```

Start a new app
```shell
python manage.py startapp <name-of-project>
```

Verify if Django is installed.
```python
import django
django.get_version()
```
